During his senior school education, he was admitted into  the Arts class as he intended to study Law when completed his secondary school.  Although he earned  a very good grade but due to lack of funds he couldn’t proceed to the university at  that time, so he was compelled to spend some time with his mummy (Alhaja) at ikire before he travelled to Lagos state so as to chart a course for his life .This amiable and focused man, started his working career with Empee textile company at Oshodi as a casual worker for two years before he noticed that he could not achieve his dream as a lawyer  if  he continued with the casual work. Meanwhile, then in his dreams most of the time he found himself with people measuring land at various places which became very worrisome to him as he could not understand the meaning  until he got a place around Muritala Airport, Ikeja where he saw a team of surveyors working on the road then he recalled his dream and started working on it .ASA then had a friend whose brother was a survey Assistant, so,  he decided to quit the factory job and started learning survey which he he learned for about four years before he graduated and started  his new career of working as a survey assistant. Being that Azeez Saleem Adewale is an Education loving person and has a passion for learning, after  working as a survey assistant he decided to enroll himself for a Remedial  Programme because he had  fallen in love with the survey profession for which he did not have the O'level  requirements to study as earlier, he completed his secondary school education as an Arts student.
                In 2009,Azeez Saleem Adewale sat for another WAEC as a science student and once again cleared all his papers which  qualified him to sit for JAMB in 2011 and scored 201 marks to secure his admission into Federal Polytechnic, llaro in 2012 where he bagged an Ordinary National Diploma is Surveying and Geo-Informatics with Upper credit.

                This focused man still believed that he had not achieved his dream, so,  in 2018, he sat for Technologists Examination under SURVEYORS COUNCIL OF NIGERIA and he passed his all papers which elevated him to  PUPIL SURVEYOR OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA in 2019. He observed his pupilage  under DATAVIEW CONSULT LIMITED from 2019 – 2021
